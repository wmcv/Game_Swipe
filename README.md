<p>Game Slide is a dynamic web app with a java backend where popular video games titles go head-to-head! Leveraging an Elo rating system commonly used in competitive chess, this app pits two random games against each other, and you get to decide which one wins. Each game’s rating updates in real time based on the viewers' choices, creating an ever-evolving leaderboard/game trend of the most popular and competitive titles.</p>
