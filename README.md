<p>Game Slide is a dynamic web app with a java backend where popular video games titles go head-to-head! Leveraging an Elo rating system commonly used in competitive chess, this app pits two random games against each other, and you get to decide which one wins. Each gameâ€™s rating updates in real time based on the users' choices, creating an ever-evolving leaderboard/game trend of the most popular and competitive titles.</p>
